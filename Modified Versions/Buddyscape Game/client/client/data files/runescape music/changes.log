v1.29 changes:
+ scape hunter
update rar stx engine -> 3.71


v1.28 changes:
update rar sfx engine -> 3.70
according to their website:
   1. New "Request administrative access" option in "Advanced" page
      of "Advanced SFX options" allows to create SFX archive,
      which will request the administrative access when started
      in Windows Vista.

      Command line equivalent of this option is -iadm switch.

   2. Correction in DBCS encoding (Japanese, Chinese, etc.) support
      in WinRAR shell extension for Windows 9x/Me.

   4. WinRAR displays a warning if resulting archive is self-extracting
      and archive size exceeds 4 GB. Windows cannot run executables
      of such size.

   5. GUI self-extracting modules support following command line
      switches:

      -d     set the destination path
      -p      specify a password
      -s           silent mode, hide all
      -s1          same as -s
      -s2          silent mode, hide start dialog
      -sp     specify parameters for setup program

   6. GUI self-extracting modules do not pass the entire command line
      to setup program like they did in previous versions.
      If you need to get access to entire command line of SFX archive,
      parse sfxcmd environment variable which contains this command line.
